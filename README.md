## ladalja
ladalja is a java library for handling database, with less code as possible, it was inspired by laravel (php framework) behavior

## Which work ladalja library will make you easy ?
* When you are doing a java project with database, you may create your beans, create the DAO interfaces and classes.<br>
This will help you in DAO works<br/>
**how?**<br/>
You will have to create your bean with some rule mentioned in documentation and then you have done your database works, like in the php laravel project.
* You may also do your project without beans or models, simply by using the QueryBuilder in library which will help you to build your query, execute it with transactions, and return result in java.util.Map object or in java.sql.ResultSet if you want;
The name of method match with name of laravel database method, thus if you know how laravel database work, you will nearly have nothing to learn.
